Millie is a day trading tool used to stream market data slowly just as it would when the market is open.

### Problem
- normal backtestings isn't enough to stimulate a real-market environment, sometimes a server might fail, or an order might not be filled, e.t.c all these factors are ignored by most backtesting tools.

### Solution
*Real market-like backtesting (tick by tick)*

Stream market data like a normal trading day. play the data second by second, minute by minute just like the real market.
